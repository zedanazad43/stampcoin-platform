## How to Push and Create PRs

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Run the provided script:
```bash
./push-deployment-branches.sh
```

This script will:
1. Push all four branches to origin
2. Create PRs using GitHub CLI if available
3. Provide manual links if GH CLI is not available

### Option 2: Manual Push and PR Creation

#### Step 1: Push all branches
```bash
git push origin add/vercel-deploy-workflow add/fly-deploy-workflow add/railway-deploy-workflow add/api-pin-endpoint
```

## PR Details

### PR 1: Add Vercel deploy workflow
**Branch**: `add/vercel-deploy-workflow`  
**Title**: Add Vercel deploy workflow  
**Description**:
```
- Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the project and deploys to Vercel on pushes to `main`.
- Validates `.env.example` exists and that `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret is set before attempting deployment.
- Uses `setup-node` cache for faster installs and `npx --yes vercel` to avoid global installs.
```

### PR 2: Add Fly deploy workflow
**Branch**: `add/fly-deploy-workflow`  
**Title**: Add Fly deploy workflow  
**Description**:
```
- Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the project and deploys to Fly on pushes to `main`.
- Validates `.env.example` exists and that `FLY_API_TOKEN` secret is set before attempting deployment.
- Requires a committed `fly.toml` and uses `flyctl` installed at runtime.
```

### PR 3: Add Railway deploy workflow
**Branch**: `add/railway-deploy-workflow`  
**Title**: Add Railway deploy workflow  
**Description**:
```
- Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the project and triggers Railway on pushes to `main`.
- Validates `.env.example` exists and that `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret is set before attempting deployment.
- Installs the Railway CLI and triggers `railway up --ci` when `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` is set; otherwise exits gracefully.
```

### PR 4: Add API pin endpoint
**Branch**: `add/api-pin-endpoint`  
**Title**: Add API pin endpoint  
**Description**:
```
- Adds serverless endpoint for pinning to nft.storage and optionally Pinata
- Compatible with Vercel Serverless (place in /api/pin.js)
- Expects POST with JSON: { name, description, imageBase64, pinata }
- Includes proper error handling and validation
```

## Branch Status

To verify branches are ready:
```bash
git branch --list "add/*" -v
```

Expected output:
```
add/api-pin-endpoint         0ce4d55 Add API pin endpoint
add/fly-deploy-workflow      9df2a16 Add Fly deploy workflow
add/railway-deploy-workflow  0bd3984 Add Railway deploy workflow
add/vercel-deploy-workflow   31b0722 Add Vercel deploy workflow
```
